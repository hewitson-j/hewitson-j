## Hello world! 👋

I'm Jacob Hewitson (but you can call me Jake too!) and I'm a frontend engineer. I'm a recent graduate from Western Governors University and am excited to begin working as a professional software engineer.


- 💻 I have worked on several freelance projects for different organizations, such as Leaps and Bounds Preschool, the author of the Mine Grinder series, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and more!
- 🧑‍💼 Now having some real world experience as a freelancer, I am looking to break into the software engineering field and get my first official software engineer job!
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a memory repository app. My extended family has a lot of physical photos which there are no digital copies of, so it would be terrible if all those memories were lost! I'm making an app which will allow authenticated users to see these pictures in photo albums which will be stored in a hosted database/bucket.
- 🌐 My stack is primarily frontend technologies like React.js, TypeScript, Javascript, and HTML/CSS. I also use SQL (Postgres and MySQL) in my projects. Even though I don't frequently work with them, I also have experience with Python, Java, and C++.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning backend web technologies such as Node.js so I can create more dynamic websites.
- 📫 You can contact me via my portfolio website at [JacobHewitson.com](https://jacobhewitson.com) or by emailing me at [jacob.a.hewitson@gmail.com](mailto:jacob.a.hewitson@gmail.com)
